description: "Women Who Tech is a diverse network of 10,000 entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, and industry leaders. We bring women together who are breaking new ground in technology and the startup sector. Since 2008, we've produced several Women Who Tech TeleSummits packed with some of the most thought-provoking discussions led by Arianna Huffington of Huffington Post, startup investor Joanne Wilson, WordPress usability expert Jane Wells of Automattic, Shaherose Charania of Founders Labs and Women 2.0, and more. In 2015 we launched the The Women Startup Challenge, one of the largest initiatives to bring together top early-stage women-led startups, that showcases and helps fund women-led ventures. In partnership with Craig Newmark of craigslist and craigconnects, the Women Startup Challenge has one goal: to disrupt a culture and economy that has made it exceedingly difficult for women entrepreneurs to access capital. Only 7% of all investor money goes to women-led startups. The Women Startup Challenge wants to crush this dismal stat."
