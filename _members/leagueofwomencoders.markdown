description: Are you a woman* who loves programming and has been searching for a similar bunch of ladies to eat cupcakes and discuss code with? Are you happier discussing Ruby** than rubies over coffee? If so, youâ€™ve come to the right place! We meet at least once a month to hack on projects, give casual 5-minute lightning talks, ask all of our technical questions, and toss around ideas together. It's a great way to make new friends, and to bounce ideas off each other to keep improving our coding skills. Think of it as a book club for coders. Yes, there will be tasty treats of the baked variety with coffee, tea, and juice (for the caffeine-averse). On hacknights, we have delicious pizza for all of your om-ing and nom-ing needs. We'd also love to bring in some interesting lady speakers, so let us know if you have anything you'd like to hear or talk about!
