description: Georgetown University Women Who Code (GUWWC) is an organization for women at Georgetown want to learn code and for those who already code. We teach on-campus lectures, our mentors meet in small groups with students, and we host social and professional events to expose students to the many opportunities for women to pursue academic and professional paths in technology.
