description: We are focused on providing women with tangible programming skills to expand their career opportunities. We are made up of a lot of study groups that learn anything in the "full stack" of development (aka from the very back end of coding involving networks and security, to the front end involving scripting and styling). Whether you love Python or are trying to learn anything you can - we are a group that allows you to pick and choose whatever fits your learning style!
